## Executive Snapshot
Mission — turn HyperEVM’s points into instantly‑liquid, on‑chain markets, create a leading platform for all things OTC. 
Problem — OTC for pre‑TGE assets is still Discord escrow chats; fraud risk & zero UX. Current on-chain OTC platforms are outdated and fail to represent market needs.
Solution — modern, sleek all-in-one OTC platform with full HyperEVM ecosystem coverage.

## Market Share & Revenue Potential
The on‑chain OTC niche exploded with Whales.market’s rise: it cleared >$250 M lifetime volume and collects ≥$1 M in fees in <18 months (dune stats for Whales.market). CEX “pre‑markets” (Bybit, Bitget, KuCoin, etc.) routinely push $1‑5 M per token in the 4‑hour window before listing. Discord escrow bots still process high‑risk deals but with meaningful six‑figure volumes. Combining these fragmented flows gives a conservative addressable market of ≈ $500 M / 30 days.

We target two markets — points markets for airdrop allocations at the start, and P2P OTC escrow for NFT's, whitelists, etc — later.

| Market Share | Monthly Volume | Protocol Fee (1%) | 80% Cash to Investors | 100k OTX monthly cash |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 0.5% | $2.5M | $25,000 | $20,000 | $2,000 / mo |
| 1.0% | $5.0M | $50,000 | $40,000 | $4,000 / mo |
| 2.5% | $12.5M | $125,000 | $100,000 | $10,000 / mo |

## Supply & Allocations
Max Supply: 1,000,000 OTX, hard-capped. No inflation ever. Burn reduces it over time.

Note: We’re not planning a DAO. Governance decisions will stay with the founding team or trusted group.

| Category | Tokens | % | Our Thinking |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Airdrops & Incentives | 600,000 | 60% | Split into two: first airdrop ~33% supply; second airdrop or future promos from the rest. Designed to grow userbase & reward traders. |
| Early Investors | 200,000 | 20% | Backers get enough to be worth it, but not so much to risk early dumps. Revenue share terms should make staking smarter than selling. |
| Team & Advisors | 100,000 | 10% | Enough to keep core contributors motivated, but not a massive chunk. Vesting ensures they can’t just bail. |
| Reserve for Emissions | 100,000 | 10% | For promos, partnerships, or future incentives if we need them. |

## Funding Round Details
Raise — 200,000$ seed capital in exchange for 200,000 OTX (20 % of the hard‑cap 1 M supply).
Instrument — revenue‑share SAFT: investors receive immediate cash flow from protocol fees and automatically convert to OTX at the token generation event (TGE).
Valuation — seed price =  1.00$ per OTX →  1 M$ fully‑diluted valuation (FDV).
For context, comparable on‑chain OTC token $WHALES debuted at 5M$ FDV and quickly re‑rated higher once fee flow proved out.
Capital Release Mechanics — investor funds sit in an escrow multisig and unlock 20 % per milestone (5 tranches for 5 phases) as code and launch objectives are delivered. Details about the phases are in the next section.
Liquidity & Exit — OTX will be listed on DEXes in HyperEVM with liquidity locked. Hyperliquid Core listings and others will follow shortly after. 
Investor Token Delivery — All 200K OTX are minted and transferred to investors at TGE with no lock‑up, but staking yields and fee discounts strongly incentivise holding.
## Roadmap & Use of Raised Funds ($200k Goal)
Breakdown of use:
Smart Contract Security Audits – Estimated cost $50k–$90k each (industry quotes: Quantstamp, CertiK, Trail of Bits). We plan 2 full audits: initial system (Escrow, MarketManager and other SC's), and a later re-audit covering updates + OTX token mechanisms → ~$100k total.
Hyperliquid Listing Fees & Integrations – Listing of OTX on Hyperliquid → estimated $30k–$50k depending on auction price.
Development, Infrastructure, Team – Salaries for 1–2 full-stack/blockchain engineers, infra (RPCs, servers, monitoring), plus possible short-term contractors for UI/UX or integrations → ~$40k–$50k.
Initial Liquidity & MM – Remaining funds allocated for creating early offers on otX.markets, incentivizing early trading, and covering gas or minimal MM to seed OTC pairs.
This breakdown ensures raised funds go directly to shipping secure, functional OTC systems and early liquidity.

| Phase | Time Estimate | Deliverables | Current Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Phase 1: SAFT executed | ~2 weeks | Seed round goal reached, product development started | In progress |
| Phase 2: MVP testnet live | ~4 weeks | MVP on testnet is fully operational with main features. | In progress |
| Phase 3: Testing & Audit | ~6 weeks | Internal & external testing, first audits, full testnet launch | Pending MVP completion |
| Phase 4: Points Campaign & Mainnet | ~4 weeks | Launch points farming campaign, Mainnet launch | Not started |
| Phase 5: TGE | ~4 weeks | Deploy OTX token, enable revenue-sharing | Not started |

## Points Campaign & Presale
Before TGE, we’ll launch a points campaign after mainnet release. Users get points for activity (trading volume, fees paid) or by buying them with USDC locked until TGE, directly on our platform. Points distribution/conversion rates will remain undisclosed.

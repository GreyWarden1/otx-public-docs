## 🚀 otX.markets

A next-gen, HyperEVM-centric OTC trading platform.

Trade airdrop allocations with the convenience of a DEX — market orders, clean UX, automated flows.

It just works — for buyers, sellers, and protocols alike.

Hyperliquifying illiquid, pre-market assets.

otX.markets is building a secure, self-custodial OTC trading platform on HyperEVM, starting with points, airdrop allocations, and unreleased NFTs, then expanding to a peer-to-peer OTC platform with staked collateral.

## OTC Today Is Broken

Most current OTC platforms for pre-market assets — points, allocations, unreleased NFTs — are basically spreadsheets on-chain. Every deal is manual, peer-to-peer, and painfully slow.

Here’s what you deal with today:

- Hope that exact market is listed
- Find someone offering the exact asset, size, and price you want
- Sign a bunch of transactions for every step
- Hope settlement works and you'll be able to wake up on time

That’s not a market — it’s a workaround.

- ❌ No real UX
- ❌ No DEX-like flow
- ❌ No account abstraction
- ❌ No ecosystem-wide listings
- ❌ No PnL, no dashboard, no automation

Pre-market trading deserves better.

## otX.markets fixes this

| Feature | What It Means |
| --- | --- |
| ⚡ DEX-style flow | Market / limit orders, real orderbook, one click. |
| 🤖 Automated settlement | Smart contracts hold collateral & close deals for you. |
| 🧠 Account Abstraction | No pop-ups mid-trade; sign once, we handle the rest. |
| 🌍 List-everything engine | Points, allocations, NFTs—if HyperEVM cares, we list it. |
| 📊 Dashboards & PnL | Positions, trade history, profit—all in one tab. |

## Why Now, Why Here?

We're building on HyperEVM because it's where attention is going. Fast.

- There are 24 projects live with points. Another 12+ are launching soon.
- Hyperliquid just revamped its points UI on testnet.
- beautiful database by @kirbyongeo - link here
- Huge portions of HYPE are set aside for future airdrops — and users are getting ready to farm.
- Meanwhile, whales.market — a clunky, barebones site — collects ~$500k/day in fees during peak pre-markets.
- And that’s without a proper UX or ecosystem coverage.

## What Makes otX Different?

- Full coverage — no curation gatekeepers.
- Instant liquidity — collateralised orderbook, not chat-based IOUs.
- Trader-grade UX — feels like Binance, settles like DeFi.
- One-in-all package — Points, NFTs, whitelists — everything you ever need.
- This isn’t just better for traders; it’s a growth hack for every HyperEVM project—we plug them straight into liquidity. It’s a win for the whole ecosystem.

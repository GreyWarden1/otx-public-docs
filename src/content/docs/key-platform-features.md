# How We Turn OTC into a Real Market
Goal: make every alternative feel outdated and slow. We treat pre‑market assets exactly like spot pairs on an exchange.
## 1) Exchange‑Grade Order Flow
• True orderbook – market & limit orders in a single transaction; engine sweeps best offers automatically.
• Batch fills – up to 150 offers cleared at once, saving 5‑10× gas versus manual fills on existing OTC sites.
• Settlement controls – seller decides when to settle, buyer sees countdown; both sides can trigger or forfeit under preset rules.
➡ Today on Whales or Discord you still click one listing at a time and pray the other wallet comes online.
## 2) 100% HyperEVM Coverage
Every points farm, allocation or unreleased NFT that matters on HyperEVM appears here—usually the same day it launches. 
## 3) Unified Portfolio & PnL Dashboard
All positions, collateral and realised PnL in one panel:
• partial close or auto‑claim in a click
• CSV / tax export
No more spreadsheets to track half‑settled deals.
## 4) Set‑and‑Forget Settlement
Contracts handle TGE events: auto‑claim for buyers, auto‑release collateral to sellers, and write the result to your dashboard—no wallet pop‑ups. Powered by account abstraction; feels like a CEX, keeps self‑custody.
## 5) Pro‑Grade P2P Desk (coming soon)
A moderated room for big bespoke deals:
• on‑chain escrow with encrypted chat
• built‑in dispute resolution
• middle‑man reputation scores
Discord OTC groups lose their edge overnight.
## 6) Founder‑Created Markets (WIP)
Teams can open a private or public point market in <60 s via access code—no gatekeeping. Instant analytics: depth, turnover, unique buyers.
## 7) Smart Alerts & API
WebSocket + REST for quants; Telegram / email pushes for everyone else—new listings, large fills, settlement reminders. Wallet watch‑lists let you shadow whales in real time.
